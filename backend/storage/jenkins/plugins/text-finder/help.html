    This plugin lets you search for some text using regular expressions in a set
    of files or the console log. Based on the outcome, you can downgrade the
    build result to <code>UNSTABLE</code>, <code>FAILURE</code>,
    <code>NOT_BUILT</code>, or <code>ABORTED</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, you can search for the string <code>failure</code> in a set of
    log files. If a match is found, you can downgrade the build result from
    <code>SUCCESS</code> to <code>FAILURE</code>. This is handy when you have
    some tools in your build chain that do not properly set the exit code.
